# Plug & Play Scanning server

Easy to use plug & play web server for scanning

### Requirements

The `scanimage` command, Imagemick for converting between formats (`pnmtojpeg`, `convert`)

### Usage

```bash
node index.js
```

(or `nodejs` on some platforms)

It runs on Port 8080 (change that in the script if you want)

Make sure your scanner is connected (either over the
network, which should work out of the box, or using
a cable), then just open the address in your browser and that's it.
It will start scanning and your browser will show the scan when it's done.
(Or while scanning, depending on how the browser handles the chunked data)

Quality is set to 300 DPI by default but feel free to change that in the script.

In fact, you can change any settings you want there.
